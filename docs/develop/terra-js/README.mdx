# Terra.js

<Admonition type="tip" icon="ðŸ’¡" title="Using Terra.js on the Terra chain">

Outside of the deprecation of the treasury, market, and oracle modules, Terra.js functionality remains relatively unchanged. There are a few additions to allow for legacy commands which are explained in the [Using Terra Classic](./terra-classic.mdx) page. 

</Admonition>

Terra.js seeks to provide a compatible way to work with the Terra blockchain within JavaScript runtimes, such as Node.js and the browser. Terra.js enables the following functions:

- Deserializing blockchain data into JavaScript objects with native data types and methods
- Serializing objects back into a blockchain-compatible format
- Providing access to the Terrad node API (LCD) from a JavaScript-based interface
- Providing additional utilities, such as hash functions and key-signing algorithms
