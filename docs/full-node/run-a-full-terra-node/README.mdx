# Run a full Terra node 


<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️" title="Recommended operating systems">

This guide has been tested against Linux distributions only. To ensure a successful production environment setup, consider using a Linux system.

</Admonition>

Running a full Terra node is a resource-intensive process that requires a persistent server. If you want to use Terra without downloading the entire blockchain, use [Terra Station](https://station.terra.money/).

If you are a developer and want to install Terrad, visit [](../../develop/terrad/install-terrad.mdx).
